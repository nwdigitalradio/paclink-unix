.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
wl2kax25 invokes the packlink\-unix AX.25 interface.  It is used to transfer data between the local paclink\-unix client and a Winlink 2000 gateway RMS.

wl2kax25 establishes an AX.25 connection between the client node and the RMS gateway \fItarget\-call\fR. wl2kax25 will wait for \fItimeout\fR seconds in order to establish the link before giving up.  All Winlink 2000 traffic that is received from the RMS is forwarded to the local email address, \fIemailaddress\fR.

Additionally, wl2kax25 will attempt to upload any outbound messages that have been queued by packlink\-unix to the RMS.
